#### Happy Mayday fellow Agents!
As my clan is getting ready for Operation Dark Hours I have prepared my Healer to be raid ready. Even though it is far away from being min-maxed I have at least found a bunch of good pieces to combine. Things marked with an asterisk are subject to change because they don't fit the build well - I simply haven't found anything better until now.

Weapon choice is obviously built around getting as many healing buffs as possible utilizing Reformation, Recharged, Rooted, etc. I have chosen to go with AR and Shotgun to get the most out of the Survivalists skill tree buffs. I maxed out stability on the AR to increase my chance of hitting headshots which procs Reformation. The Shotgun is simply there to burst down an enemy that comes to close. As I will mostly be tumbling around the group this often comes in handy. I have chosen the one with the highest base damage and Overlap as the holster talent to increase weapon handling for the AR even further.

Armor rolls with all Capacitive and Safeguard on the backpack, even though it will be nerfed, anything that increases my healing done is appreciated. Also, my cooldown reduction needs to be lower as I am beyond the cap of 50%. I would rather swap the China Light and D&H for maybe something like Gila Guard or Richter&Kaiser to increase Armor, Health and Hazard Protection. This would be the goal for the Armor to be more appropriate for the build.

With Skill-Cooldown and Skill-Cooldown-Mods, my cooldown for both the Seeker Mine and Chem Launcher are coming down to 10s. 5s for the Seeker Mine if I destroy it. I have also increased my Chem Launcher charges to 10 with mods.

Now, without further ado here comes the build:
