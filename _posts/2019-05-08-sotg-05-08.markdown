This week's State of the Game livestream for The Division 2 covered the changes coming in title update 3.

As soon as the official recap goes live we'll link it here â€“ but most importantly the heavily awaited title update 3 is coming next week. And the raid will follow shortly after to give players time to adjust their builds to the upcoming update.

A few bullet points from the patch notes:
* Gear score increase will not come with TU3  
* Contaminated gear now will always drop on 500 if the player has reached 500  
* Stronghold Bosses, Heroic Mission Bosses, Control Point level 4 Bosses will also drop 500 gearscore items if the player has reached 500
